# tesseract-ocr-project

In this project we are building on top of tesseract optical character detection api to read the ingredients from the product label and pass it through the LLM to give the health advised based on the input provided


# backend  flow
1) OCR detection
2) extract the text from the image 
3) pass it through the LLM(langchain or LlamaIndex)
4) we can also use a fine tuned health model
5) get the advise from the LLM 
6) display it in the response box


#   frontend needed
1) image upload
2) display the image
3) display the response box
4) display the health advise



# The creativity of the project
Practical Application: The project directly addresses a real-world problem: helping users make informed decisions about food consumption based on their health needs.
Combination of Technologies: Effectively leveraging OCR and LLM together demonstrates a good understanding of both technologies and their potential synergies.
Potential for Expansion: The core concept can be extended to analyze other product labels (e.g., cosmetics, household cleaning products) or to provide additional features like ingredient substitution suggestions.
